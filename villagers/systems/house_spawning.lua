-- When to populate
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Two triggers, because chunk generation alone never worked here:
--
--   * A village is bigger than the chunk that builds it. The placer
--     blits schematics into neighbouring chunks, and those chunks have
--     usually generated already - their bed scan ran, found bare ground
--     and will never run again. Worse, the placer can retry for nearly
--     half a minute before it builds, so even the triggering chunk's
--     scan could run before a single bed existed. That is why a large
--     village came out with two villagers in it.
--   * The y band was clamped to 80, while villages place as high as
--     lualore_village_y_max (200 by default). A village above that line
--     got nobody at all.
--
-- So the village placer now calls populate() over the village's own
-- bounds as soon as it has finished building, and the chunk hook stays
-- on for beds that are not part of a village - a house a player built,
-- or anything from another mod - with a y band that matches where
-- villages can actually be.
