-- THE VAGRANT - knows where things are, and trades it for a meal
-- ===================================================================
-- He has no workstation and nothing to sell. What he has is knowing the
-- country: feed him and he tells you about somewhere worth going, and
-- marks it on your view.
--
-- Everything he knows already exists. The village placer, the ruins, the
-- obsidian door shrines and the sky sites each keep a record of what
-- they have built, for their own /find_ commands. He reads those, skips
-- anything you have already been told about, and picks the nearest thing
-- you have not seen.
--
-- That makes him the one villager who connects the rest of the mod
-- together, which is worth more than any item he could hand over.
