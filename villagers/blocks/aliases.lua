-- VILLAGE PROPS - legacy aliases and the biome marker map
-- ===================================================================
-- This mod grew out of the Native Villages mod, and the .mts schematics
-- still carry that mod's node names. Every village prop baked into a
-- building - the barrels, hookahs, sledges, fish traps and shrines - is
-- stored as `nativevillages:<name>`, while this mod registers them as
-- `lualore:<name>`. With nothing mapping one to the other, every single
-- prop generated as an unknown node, and three things broke with it:
--
--   1. The props did not render at all.
--   2. Biome detection (see the marker map below) looks for props near a
--      bed to decide which biome's villagers to spawn. It never found
--      one, so EVERY village in EVERY biome spawned grassland villagers.
--   3. Anything that wants to use a prop as a workstation had nothing to
--      attach to.
--
-- minetest.register_alias is the right fix rather than re-saving 53
-- schematics: the engine resolves aliases both when place_schematic
-- reads the file AND when an already-generated mapblock is loaded, so
-- existing worlds heal themselves as the player walks around. It is also
-- safe if the original nativevillages mod happens to be installed -
-- Luanti ignores an alias whose name is already a registered item.
--
-- One of these is a rename, not just a namespace swap: the jungle prop
-- was `cannibalshrine` and is now `lualore:jungleshrine`.

-- Which prop signals which biome's villagers. house_spawning.lua and
-- village_commands.lua both search for these near a bed; they used to
-- carry their own copies of this table, and both copies listed three
-- nodes that do not exist (`grasslandaltar` is registered nowhere,
-- `desertcarpet` and `savannashrine` are misspellings of the real node
-- ids). One table, one place to fix.
--
-- Grassland is still the right default when nothing is found: the only
-- grassland marker is the barrel, which appears solely in the market and
-- the stable, and both of those are rolled per village - so plenty of
-- grassland villages legitimately have no marker at all.
