# Lua Lore

A villager and lore mod for Luanti that adds living villages across multiple biomes with NPCs that have moods, trades, and unique behaviors. Explore floating sky cities, discover underground wizard castles, and interact with diverse communities.

## Features

### 🏘️ Biome Villages

Villages generate naturally in six distinct biomes:

- **Grassland** - Farming communities with traditional architecture
- **Desert** - Oasis settlements with markets and exotic trades
- **Savanna** - Tribal villages with ceremonial shrines
- **Lake** - Fishing communities built near water
- **Ice** - Hardy settlements in frozen tundra
- **Jungle** - Tribal communities with unique customs

### 👥 Villager Types

Villages are populated with different NPCs, each with their own trades and behaviors:

- **Farmers** - Trade crops and food
- **Blacksmiths** - Trade tools and weapons
- **Jewelers** - Trade gems and metals
- **Fishermen** - Trade fish and aquatic items
- **Clerics** - Trade mystical items
- **Rangers** - Protect villages from monsters
- **Entertainers** - Add atmosphere to villages
- **Witches** - Hostile magic users with teleportation abilities
- **Raiders & Hostile NPCs** - Dangerous enemies

### 🎭 Villager Moods

NPCs have emotions that affect their behavior. They display mood icons above their heads and make sounds based on how they feel. Villagers can be happy, content, neutral, sad, angry, hungry, lonely, or scared.

Feed them bread or apples to keep them happy, and trade with them to reduce their loneliness.

### 💱 Trading

Hold an item a villager wants and approach them. They'll show a trade icon when interested. Right-click while sneaking or punch with the trade item to complete the trade.

### 🧙 Cave Wizards

Deep underground in rare cave castles, you'll find powerful wizards of four colors:

- **Black Wizards** - Wield dark magic
- **White Wizards** - Channel pure energy
- **Red Wizards** - Command fire magic
- **Gold Wizards** - Master precious magic

Defeat them to obtain their magical wands, which grant you powerful abilities. Each wand type has unique magical properties for combat and exploration.

### 🛡️ Valkyries & Sky Folk

High above the clouds, floating sky villages hold an ancient secret. Valkyries of four colors guard imprisoned Sky Folk:

- **Blue Valkyries**
- **Green Valkyries**
- **Violet Valkyries**
- **Gold Valkyries**

Defeat the Valkyries to free the Sky Folk. Once liberated, they'll mark the location of other captive Sky Folk with magical pins and send you on quests to free their companions. Free enough Sky Folk and earn special rewards.

### 🏗️ Village Buildings

Each biome has unique structures including houses, churches, markets, stables, shrines, and special decorative elements. Villages generate naturally and feature authentic architecture for their environment.

### 🚪 Smart Doors

Village doors automatically open when NPCs approach and close after they pass through.

**Personal Note**: Why was this created? The short story is that I have three adopted children who came to me obsessed with MCraft. I host my own services at home and came across Luanti, and instantly saw the vast potential for endless adventures. I wanted to avoid an outright clone, or outright familiar experience, so we landed on Asuna, which is an awesome blank slate to really build the world you desire. We craved something beyond adding in hostile mobs (which we did, and love what the community has built), and something a bit more than just some random villages. What I hope this mod does is inspire the building of lore for Luanti's games. I'd love to see the community embrace, or add, Lore Jams, and not just the neat Game Jams that everyone looks forward too. The community has really built something awesome, and I think creating more wonder and lore for users to install and interact with will really add a sense of wonder and curiosity to one of the best open world experiences that exists.

**Acknowledgement**: This game was built on the Bolt.new/Bolt.diy platform using Claude Code. AI is a fantastic tool to help unlock the ideas of those who lack the ability, bring those ideas to life. It certainly helps to have some technical and coding background, as it helps you "speak dev" in a more efficient way with AI.
