# ☁️ Sky Sites (floating buildings)

The buildings on the floating crystal islands are placed by
`valkyrie/floating_buildings.lua`. It follows the same design as the ground
villages (`villagers/VILLAGE_PLACEMENT.md`) and reuses their ground module.

## Why the old system was replaced

The sky buildings used to be four schematic **decorations** — `skycastle`
plus three `skyhouse` variants — sharing two noises:

1. **Density was enormous.** The engine places `sidelen² × noise_value`
   decorations per `sidelen` division at *random* positions. With
   `sidelen = 120` and a noise scale of `0.0018` that allows up to **~26 sky
   houses inside one 120×120 division**, and up to ~9 castles per 100×100
   division.
2. **No spacing rule, no footprint test.** Every building blits with
   `force_placement`, so as soon as a division rolled more than one they
   overwrote each other into a mound of walls — and nothing checked that the
   island underneath was big enough to hold them.
3. **The castle was not rare.** It rolled from its own noise at roughly the
   same density as the houses, so the building that holds the valkyrie
   chests turned up constantly.
4. **Chests landed in the wrong building, and there were four of them.**
   The generator looked for `everness:mineral_torch` within 40 nodes of any
   crystal-grass blob and converted the first four. The castle carries
   exactly four of those torches as anchors — but `skyhouse1` carries
   eight, so houses regularly swallowed the chests. Four chests also meant
   sixteen valkyries, since opening one releases four.

## How it works now

- The sky is divided into a grid of `spacing × spacing` cells. Each cell has
  **one** candidate position, jittered in the middle half of the cell, so two
  sky sites can never be closer than half the spacing.
- A cell builds when it passes the `chance` roll and its candidate stands on
  a **crystal island** — the surface node decides, so no biome-name matching
  is involved.
- The island is read **once** with a VoxelManip into a height grid. That grid
  answers every later question: is there enough island for a cluster, does
  this footprint sit on solid ground, and which columns get dressed.
- The layout is **planned completely before anything is placed**: the castle
  (when the site rolled one) in the middle, then houses on a ring whose
  radius follows an organic outline borrowed from
  `villagers/systems/village_ground.lua`. Footprints may never overlap and
  must stand on island, so nothing is ever built on top of anything else.
- Any footprint column still hanging over air gets a short plug of island
  stone. Nothing is ever carved away — only air is filled.
- The cluster is **fitted to the island**, not the other way round: the
  placer measures how far solid ground reaches around the candidate and
  shrinks the layout to match. Islands reaching less than 12 nodes get
  nothing at all; below 26 nodes a site stays a hamlet even if it rolled a
  castle. Measured on test islands: radius 11 and under build nothing,
  14–22 give hamlets of 2–3 houses, 30 and up give a castle with 4 houses
  around it. An island just over the castle threshold may hold the castle
  alone, which is a fine look for a fortress island.
- **The castle is rolled separately and rarely.** Most sites are plain
  hamlets of 2–6 houses.
- **One valkyrie chest, in the castle only.** Opening it releases four
  valkyries at once, so a single chest is the whole fight. It goes on the
  lowest mineral torch inside the castle's own footprint (nearest the middle
  on a tie), so it sits on a floor the player walks onto. The castle's other
  three torches — and all eight in `skyhouse1` — stay lit torches.
- **The chest is always generated closed.** It is placed as
  `lualore:valkyrie_chest` (the closed node, never `..._opened`), `set_node`
  drops any metadata at that position, and the `opened` flag is then written
  as `0` explicitly. Right-clicking it is what starts the battle.
- Sites are recorded in mod storage, so a cell that has already built is
  never built again — important in the sky, where an island can straddle
  several vertical chunks that each trigger generation.
- Sky Folk are spawned once per built site (`sky_villages.spawn_sky_folk`),
  at the site centre rather than at a random patch of crystal grass.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lualore_sky_buildings` | `true` | Enable automatic placement. |
| `lualore_sky_spacing` | `360` | Nodes between grid cells. Lower = more sites. |
| `lualore_sky_chance` | `0.8` | Fraction of cells that attempt a site. |
| `lualore_sky_castle_chance` | `0.15` | Chance a site is built around a skycastle. |
| `lualore_sky_houses_min` | `2` | Minimum houses per site. |
| `lualore_sky_houses_max` | `6` | Maximum houses per site. |
| `lualore_sky_radius` | `30` | Base cluster radius; grows with the house count and again for castle sites. |
| `lualore_sky_dressing` | `true` | Crystal grass and paths between the buildings. |
| `lualore_sky_y_min` | `500` | Bottom of the sky search band. |
| `lualore_sky_y_max` | `31000` | Top of the sky search band. |

Tuning recipes:

- **Rarer castles (rarer chests):** lower `lualore_sky_castle_chance` to
  `0.08`. At the defaults a castle turns up roughly once per 1250×1250
  nodes of sky *that actually has islands*.
- **More sky hamlets:** lower `lualore_sky_spacing` (280, 240). Remember
  that cells whose candidate finds no island build nothing, so the real
  density is set as much by how common the islands are as by this number.
- **Bigger hamlets:** raise `lualore_sky_houses_max`; the cluster radius
  widens automatically.
- Settings apply to **newly generated chunks** only. Use `/spawn_skysite`
  to preview changes immediately.

## Commands

| Command | Privs | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/spawn_skysite [castle\|hamlet]` | server | Builds a sky site on the island you are standing on. `castle` forces the skycastle, `hamlet` forbids it. |
| `/find_skysite [radius]` | — | Nearest recorded sky site (default radius 2000), and whether it has a castle. |
| `/place_fortress_chests` | give | Repair tool for older worlds: places **one** closed valkyrie chest on the mineral torch nearest you, so you choose the room. |
| `/spawn_skyvillage` | give | Unchanged: spawns Sky Folk and a valkyrie as *entities*, builds nothing. |

## The palette

`SKY_PALETTE` at the top of `floating_buildings.lua` has the same shape as a
village palette (`villagers/buildings/*.lua`): which nodes count as island
`surface`, the schematic `offset`, the `fill` used for foundations, the
`castle` and `houses` schematics, and the `ground`/`plants` tables the
dressing pass reads. Adding a second sky biome means adding another table
like it. Unknown node names are dropped at first use, so the palette may
name blocks a given world does not have.

## Notes

- Already-generated sky chunks keep whatever they had before this system;
  the new placer only affects newly generated chunks. Old overlapping
  clusters stay where they are.
- `house_spawning.lua` clamps its bed scan to `y ≤ 80`, so its crystal-forest
  branch never fires on real sky islands. Sky Folk up there come from the
  per-site spawn described above, not from beds.
- The old generator scanned a 51×21×51 box of `get_node` calls (≈54,000 per
  triggered chunk, on 15% of all sky chunks) just to find a crystal-grass
  blob. That scan is gone.
